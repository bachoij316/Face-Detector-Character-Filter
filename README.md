# Face-Detector-Character-Filter

Face Detector and Character Filter is a simple program used three python libraries, OpenCV, dlib, and NumPy which help handling images and n-dimensional arrays. 

With using dlib library, detect faces on the image and mark detected faces as white box. In addition, it detects 68 face landmarks and mark them as white dots, and it keep tracking the faces.

Based on the detecting, a character image locates on the detected spot and overlay face appropriately with little location adjustment.
